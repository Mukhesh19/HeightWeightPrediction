# HeightWeightPrediction

I chose this dataset as it is simple and talks about height and weight measurements of individuals. This analysis aims to determine the correlation between height and weight in a dataset to identify patterns that can inform health and fitness recommendations. By understanding how these variables influence each other, the goal is to develop predictive models for health assessments, ultimately improving overall well-being.

# After running the respected models, I have summarised my model and reflection below. 


# Model Training 

A linear regression model was used to analyze the relationship between height and weight. The model’s coefficients indicate that for every unit increase in height, the predicted weight increases by approximately 2.93 pounds. The intercept suggests the predicted weight when height is zero, though this is more of a theoretical value. 

 

# Evaluation Metrics 

The model’s performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The R-squared value of 0.24 indicates that the model explains 24.13% of the variance in weight, suggesting that while there is a correlation, other factors also play a significant role. 

 

# Potential Improvements 

The reflection highlights the potential for enhancing the model’s predictive capability. This could involve incorporating additional relevant features, improving data preprocessing techniques, or experimenting with more complex models. Continuous refinement based on these evaluations can lead to a more robust and effective predictive model.
